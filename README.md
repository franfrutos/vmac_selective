# THE ROLE OF SELECTIVE ATTENTION IN VMAC

This project is the repository for all data, scripts, and materials used for the manuscript entitled: "***The role of selective attention in value-modulated attentional capture***".

### Project Structure ###

The project is divided into the following main sections:

- **Input**: Where the raw data will be stored.
- **Output**: Contains the use of R objects, which are time-consuming to calculate, and the plot generated by **Scripts**.
- **Scripts**: Includes scripts used to run the analysis.
- **pre_registration**: A folder in which we describe in detail the preregistered hypothesis and analysis plan.
- **Manuscript**: A folder with manuscript related files-.
- **Materials**: Contains the files with the experimental task used.

##### Scripts folder structure #####

The **scripts** folder is simple:

- *analysis.R*: The script used in the **Result** section.
- *power_analysis.R*: The script we used to perform the preregistered power analysis.
- *meta-analysis.R*: The script for the meta-analyses presented in the main text.

All of the above .R files implicitly call `source(...)` to run *functions.R* to load helper functions into the workspace.

#### Reproducible Manuscript ####

This study uses both [quarto-preprint](https://github.com/mvuorre/quarto-preprint) and [apaquarto](https://github.com/wjschne/apaquarto) to generate a reproducible preregistration and manuscript, respectively.
